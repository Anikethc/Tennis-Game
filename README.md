# Web Development

Hello Everyone! Welcome to my GitHub repo 'Web Development'.

## Contents of this Repo

In this repo, I will be storing all of my web development projects. The projects are as follows:

### Tennis Game

This is my only project right now in the repository. You can open up the 'Tennis Game' folder and download the 3 files. While downloading, keep all of them in the same directory.

After downloading, click on the `index.html` file and it opens up the game.

On the left is you and on the right, it's the computer playing. It's a simple game of Tennis. You are moving the paddle on the left (which is yours) with your mouse. When the opponent doesn't hit the ball, you get a point. Your score is shown on the top. Whoever reaches 15 first wins!

## Can You Use It?

Yes, you can download this repo and use it for your own purposes.

You have the right to download, modify, and share it to others. One thing that I don't want you to do is to sell this software to anyone.

## Issues & Bugs

If you encounter any issues or bugs, you can visit the 'Issues' tab in my repository and create an issue. I will immediately look into it and resolve as soon as possible.

## Any Doubts or Questions

If you have any doubts or questions, you are always free to ask me. I will be available on Quora (quora.com/profile/Aniketh-Chavare-1), Twitter (twitter.com/anikethchavare), and Discord (AnikethC#6392).

## Conclusion

Thank you everyone, I hope you liked my repo!
