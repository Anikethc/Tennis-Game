# Tennis Game

Hello Everyone! Welcome to my GitHub repo 'Tennis Game'. I created this simple tennis game using JavaScript.

## How to Open It?

You can download the code, and open the `index.html` file. While downloading the code, keep all the files in the same directory.

## How to Play It?

The left paddle is you and the right one is the computer. It's a simple game of Tennis.

You can move your paddle with your mouse, but the mouse should always be in the black canvas. When the opponent doesn't hit the ball, you get a point and vice-versa. Your's and the computer's score will be show at the top. Whoever reaches 15 first wins!
